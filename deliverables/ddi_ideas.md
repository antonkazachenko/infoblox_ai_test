- Add OUI/vendor enrichment for MACs to help asset classification.
- Resolve PTR/A records (when networked) to validate FQDN consistency and detect split-horizon discrepancies.
- Classify device roles using hostname patterns plus CMDB tags (LLM-backed if ambiguous).
- Use subnet discovery to suggest actual CIDR lengths (e.g., infer /25+/26 from adjacent inventory).
- Incorporate ticketing/ownership lookup to reconcile multiple owners or stale contacts.
